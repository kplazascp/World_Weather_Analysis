# World_Weather_Analysis
In this project we are helping Jack to build PlanMyTrip, where will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
To be able to do this, we colcected an analyzed weather data across cities worldwide, by using NumPy, Citipy, OpenWeatherMap API and collect the information for:
- City, country, and date
- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Humidity
- Cloudiness
- Wind speed
Then, we visualized the travel data by creating heatmaps with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer's travel preferences.

## Challenges and difficulties
The Google map API did work, but it didn't show the figure, only the message: Figure(layout=FigureLayout(height='420px'))
For that reason, the data can be seen in the tables, but not an image of the map.
